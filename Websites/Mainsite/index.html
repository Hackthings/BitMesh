					<p>
						BitMesh is developing a platform to allow people to share their internet connection with peers in exchange for bitcoin while leveraging existing devices and internet architecture. Negotiation of the price of data takes place in a local "marketplace", achieving a fair price for internet without requirement for a contract or third party escrow. The end result is cheaper, more robust internet service and bitcoin in more people’s hands.

										<h3>Our Mission</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Provide a solution that is ubiquitous across all devices, platforms and locations. This includes a phased approach to integrating with handset devices, desktop systems and eventually networking hardware. The resulting product is decentralized and user controlled with no necessity to communicate or interact with anyone to begin buying and selling.</p>

											<h3>FAQ</h3>
										</header>
										<p><b>How far along are you?</b>
										<br>
										<blockquote>We have a working prototype. You can set up a BitMesh server on a raspberry pi and have multiple clients connect to it. It establishes micropayment channels (a bitcoin technology) between the server and client and uses a captive portal to titrate internet time given to the user based on how much the user has paid so far. The user simply sets a policy and goes.</blockquote></p>
									</section>
									<section>
										<p><b>Why did you pick this idea to work on?</b>
									
									 	<blockquote>
									 We set up a meshnet in our office one weekend. We were very excited about it and were plotting how to get downtown Santa Cruz on a meshnet, but were stumped on how to incentivize it. Coupons, bulletin boards, community chat, nothing seemed very compelling. We became  more interested in bitcoin and realized that the micropayment channel technology could allow people to pay only for the internet they use at very high resolution. I'd worked on several bitcoin projects by that time and Andrew has a strong networking background.<br><br>
									
									People use the internet all the time. They usually pay for it in big globs, and they can't resell it. Neighbors could save money by reselling their internet to each other. Coffeeshops could have a smoother on-ramp to their captive portals. We've lived through and are burned out on the contract based model for buying internet.

						<p>Andrew Donley builds custom front-end applications and embedded systems for enterprise clients in the software and hardware industry. His work is implemented across organizations ranging from start-ups to marquee technology firms including LG, Samsung, and Shop.com. Andrew specializes in programming with C, Android, Java, Bash, and JavaScript. He has a patent-pending for a compression algorithm that adheres to the gzip file format and compresses/decompresses 4-8x faster than standard gzip in most circumstances. The resulting files were decompress-able by any standard zlib - gzip decompression utility.
						
						  Andrew holds a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of San Diego.</p>
